<h3><strong><em>The basic idea is to create an online store where the user can perform some actions such 
  as searching for an item, viewing its details, adding it to the cart, and then purchasing.</em></strong> </h3>

<br><hr/> <br>
<h3>Here <strong>3</strong> user types: admin, moderator,  user. <h3>

<h4> <strong>Admin</strong> controls all the data. Manages with CRUDs.
<strong>Moderator</strong> also controls all the data—é However, the moderator does not have full rights to manage the data. Some things he cannot control.
<strong>User</strong> controls only his data. Also can buy items.<h4>
